## Contributing

Before commiting to the repo, use the following command to set the git hook path. A script to update *cargoHash* flake.nix will be executed automatically. Please make sure you have nix and nix-update installed.

```sh
  git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

(This can be done with github workflow. However, considering the small scale of the project, I do not think it is necessary at the current stage. Pull requests are welcomed!)
